# Project Definition Document

## Project Title
Health Center Simulation

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to simulate the operations of a health center, focusing on customer wait times, service times, and doctor utilization. The simulation aims to provide insights into the efficiency of the health center and identify areas for improvement.

## Description
This project simulates a health center where customers arrive, wait for service, and are attended to by doctors. The simulation tracks various metrics such as wait times, service times, and doctor utilization rates. The data is visualized using charts to provide a clear understanding of the health center's performance.

## Key Features
- **Customer Queue Management**: Customers are added to a queue upon arrival and wait for service.
- **Doctor Assignment**: Doctors are assigned to customers based on availability.
- **Wait Time Tracking**: The wait time for each customer is tracked and displayed.
- **Service Time Tracking**: The service time for each customer is tracked and displayed.
- **Doctor Utilization**: The average service time per doctor is calculated and displayed.
- **Performance Metrics**: Various performance metrics such as average wait time and average service time are calculated and displayed.
- **Visualizations**: Data is visualized using charts to provide a clear understanding of the health center's performance.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaFX**: For building the user interface.
- **FXML**: For defining the layout of the user interface.
- **Java**: For implementing the simulation logic.
- **MariaDB**: For storing customer and doctor data.
